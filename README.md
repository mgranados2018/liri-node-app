# liri-node-app

Purpose: 

This is for homework 10 that allowed us to create an app which pulls up information from the movies OMD api, Spotify API and BandsinTown API based on command line input (CLI). Technologies used were Axios, switch statements and callback functions. 

The following NPM packages were used to be able to pull different command line inputs: 

Node-Spotify-API
Axios
Moment
DotEnv
